CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddynamic_reconfigure.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dynamic_reconfigure", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "dynamic_reconfigure" with any of the following names:

    dynamic_reconfigureConfig.cmake
    dynamic_reconfigure-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dynamic_reconfigure" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "dynamic_reconfigure_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "dynamic_reconfigure" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
