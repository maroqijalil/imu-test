[0.188s] CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
[0.189s]   No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
[0.192s]   contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
[0.192s]   code such as
[0.192s] 
[0.193s]     project(ProjectName)
[0.193s] 
[0.193s]   near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().
[0.193s] 
[0.194s]   CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
[0.194s]   line.
[0.194s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[1.518s] CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/ros/foxy/share/ament_cmake_core/cmake/core/list_append_unique.cmake:30 (if):
[1.519s]   Policy CMP0057 is not set: Support new IN_LIST if() operator.  Run "cmake
[1.519s]   --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
[1.519s]   set the policy and suppress this warning.
[1.520s] 
[1.520s]   IN_LIST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
[1.520s]   Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
